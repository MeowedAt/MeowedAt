# ❤ Hello!
Welcome to my github page, where you can find most of my public repositories! Here is some information about what I do.
## 😎 Projects
I am working on a Python (Pygame) game called Bacterium, which will be completely open source. The game is just for me to practise my programming skills. With this project I learn something new everyday. I also own a minecraft server and I wish to custom code it 👌
## 😂 Me
I like coding.
